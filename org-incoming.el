;;; Commentary:

;; This is `org-incoming`, a package to ingest PDF files into your `org` or
;; `org-roam` files.

;; This package is intended to help you if you have a large number of "incoming"
;; PDF files, for example scanned handwritten notes, and you want to somehow
;; capture these PDFs in your org files.  "Capturing" here can mean anything
;; from completely transcribing them (or taking OCRed text in the PDF) to just
;; creating an org file with a title, a date and maybe some tags, which links to
;; the archived PDF.
